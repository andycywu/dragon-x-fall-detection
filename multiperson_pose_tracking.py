# ðŸ“Œ Module: multiperson_pose_tracking.py

# ðŸ§  Task Overview:
# Add support for multi-person pose detection with target tracking to avoid misclassification in fall detection.

# âœ… Goals:
# 1. Detect multiple people in the frame using a multi-person pose estimation model (e.g. MoveNet MultiPose).
# 2. Assign a unique ID to each person detected.
# 3. Allow "target lock" mode: track only one selected person (e.g. elderly person).
# 4. Integrate optional facial or clothing-based ReID (re-identification) for target person verification.
# 5. When multiple people are present, prioritize the person closest to center of frame or who remains longest.

# ðŸ§© Suggested Functions:
# - detect_multiple_poses(image: np.ndarray) -> List[Dict]  # Returns list of people with keypoints and ID
# - lock_on_target_person(initial_frame: np.ndarray) -> int  # Select target person by location/face/clothes
# - get_pose_of_target(people: List[Dict], target_id: int) -> Dict  # Extract only target pose data
# - display_ui_target_selector(people: List[Dict]) -> int  # (Optional) Add Streamlit selector to choose ID

# ðŸ“¦ Data:
# Use a placeholder model like MoveNet MultiPose or simulate with bounding boxes.
# Assign simple IDs (e.g. 0,1,2) to each person detected.
# Store current `target_id` globally or in session state.

# ðŸ”” Output:
# Only process pose analysis for locked-on target person.
# Display current target ID and coordinates on screen.

# ðŸŽ¯ Bonus:
# Use a simple color blob detection to lock onto "red shirt" or similar if no face embedding is used.

# Now write a full working Python module with placeholder functions, mock detection data, and basic integration with Streamlit.
